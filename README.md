# Horodateur
A Visual Basic punch clock desktop application that meets the strict requirements of the company it was made for

This application was written in Visual Basic on summer 2014. 

Saving:
  The data is saved in a single SQL database
  To import or export data, the user can either replace the SQL database file, or XML files
  
Code:
  The whole application was written using the Visual Basic
  Windows Forms Application libraries were used for the display
  Object-oriented programming was used for logic treatment
  
  
Important note: This project was my first big project. 
  The reader may see extremely bad implementations such as code duplication or handmade O(n2) sorting algorithms.
  I am totally aware of these mistakes, but don't have the time to fix them.
